Operators need the ability to tune polling frequency per-collector to balance CPU/IO, battery, and timeliness. This task adds config, runtime endpoints, and documentation.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria:\\n- Add per-collector polling interval configuration via: 1) `hostagent.yaml` config file (per-collector keys), 2) environment variables `HOSTAGENT_\u003cCOLLECTOR\u003e_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC`, and 3) CLI flags for simulate/test runs.\\n- Implement runtime endpoints: `GET /v1/collectors/{collector}/poll_interval` and `POST /v1/collectors/{collector}/poll_interval` to view and update the interval without restart. POST accepts `{ \"interval_seconds\": \u003cnumber\u003e }` and validates min/max bounds.\\n- Ensure iMessage, LocalFS, and Contacts collectors read the effective interval and apply it for scheduling/backoff; new collectors should reuse the same scheduling helper.\\n- Validate that changes via environment, config file, and runtime API follow this precedence: API update \u003e env var \u003e config file \u003e default (60s). Document this precedence in `AGENTS.md` and `hostagent/QUICKSTART.md`.\n- Add unit tests for scheduling helper and integration tests that simulate changing the poll interval at runtime and confirm the collector respects the new interval within one cycle.\n- Add labels: `service/hostagent`, `type/task`, `risk/low`, `priority:P2`.\n\\nNotes:\\n- Use sensible min/max (min 5s, max 86400s = 1 day) and defensive validation.\\n- Prefer a small, shared scheduling utility that emits schedule ticks and supports update at runtime and backoff.\\n- Keep changes backwards compatible; default behavior remains current schedule if no config provided.\\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-27T23:59:22.170445-04:00","updated_at":"2025-10-27T23:59:22.234482-04:00"}

{"id":"hv-37","title":"Add OpenAPI exporter endpoint to HostAgent runtime","description":"Goal\nAdd a canonical, runtime OpenAPI exporter to the HostAgent Swift service so the service can serve its OpenAPI spec (JSON and/or YAML) and be the single source-of-truth for API docs. This will eliminate spec drift and allow automation (mkdocs/exporter) to fetch the live spec during docs builds or CI.\n\nBackground\nCurrently the repo contains a static `openapi/hostagent.yaml` authored by hand and a Python exporter that writes a Redoc page for it. HostAgent is a macOS-native Swift service; there is no runtime OpenAPI endpoint. That produces drift risk when new routes or request/response schemas are added in Swift.\n\nScope\n- Add an endpoint to HostAgent that exposes the service's OpenAPI specification at `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml` (YAML optional). The endpoint should be enabled in dev/build configurations and guarded behind admin or local-only access in production if required by config.\n- Generate OpenAPI programmatically from the HostAgent router/handlers and bundled JSON schemas in `Resources/*/schemas/*.schema.json` (merge those into components.schemas). If full programmatic generation is infeasible, provide a build-time task that composes the OpenAPI spec from route metadata + JSON schemas and writes a file to `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` that the server serves statically.\n- Ensure the exporter includes the Collector routes, email utilities, FSWatch, face detection, OCR, entities, modules, metrics, and health endpoints already present in the router.\n- Add minimal tests that exercise the endpoint and verify the presence of key paths and the `CollectorRunRequest` schema in components.\n- Update docs/dev workflow: the Python `scripts/export_openapi.py` (or docs hooks) can optionally fetch the runtime `/openapi.yaml` (if server running) or read the build-time generated `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` during docs builds/CI.\n\nDesign notes\n- Runtime approach (preferred long-term): implement a small OpenAPI-builder utility in Swift that walks the Router/PatternRouteHandler registrations and collects path patterns, methods, and handler metadata. For each route, include a path entry with sensible default request/response schemas, and resolve component schemas by importing JSON schema files from Resources.\n  - Expose endpoints: `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml` (Content-Type application/json / application/x-yaml).\n  - Add a config toggle: `openapi.enabled: true|false`, default true in dev, false in production unless explicitly enabled.\n  - Secure the endpoint optionally with the hostagent auth header (configurable) or limit to localhost only.\n\n- Build-time fallback (lower risk): add a Swift PackageTarget/tool that generates `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` from the same route discovery utility and schema files. Add a Makefile or SPM run target `swift run hostagent-openapi --emit-resources` to write the file into `Resources/OpenAPI/` which will be bundled and served as static files.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- The HostAgent binary serves an OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.yaml` when `openapi.enabled` is true (or the generated resource file exists). The spec includes paths for collectors (including `imessage` and `email_imap`) and contains `components.schemas.CollectorRunRequest` matching the JSON schema in `Resources/Collectors/schemas/collector_run_request.schema.json`.\n- Unit/integration test that makes a local request to `/openapi.yaml` and asserts the spec contains `/v1/collectors/imessage:run` and `components.schemas.CollectorRunRequest`.\n- `scripts/export_openapi.py` can optionally be updated to fetch the runtime `/openapi.yaml` (if server available) during docs builds — documented in the README/dev docs.\n\nImplementation tasks\n1. Add a new Swift module `HostOpenAPI` or utility inside HostAgent to build the spec.\n2. Implement route-walker that introspects `Router` / `PatternRouteHandler` registrations.\n3. Merge JSON schemas from `Resources/**/schemas/*.schema.json` into `components.schemas`.\n4.

Add config flag to enable/disable endpoint and optional local-only/auth restrictions.\n6. Add tests covering presence of key paths and schemas.\n7. Optional: update `scripts/export_openapi.py` doc/comments to support fetching runtime spec.\n\nNotes / Risks\n- Programmatic route introspection in Swift depends on the router implementation. If introspection is not possible, the build-time generator fallback will be used.\n- Care must be taken to not leak sensitive data (authentication headers, internal endpoints).

Gateway API\n   - Add endpoints:\n     - GET /v1/imap/state?account_id={id}\u0026folder={folder} -\u003e {\"last_processed_uid\": \u003cint\u003e, \"updated_at\": \"\u003ciso\u003e\"}\n     - POST/PUT /v1/imap/state -\u003e {account_id, folder, last_processed_uid} (idempotent write)\n   - Validate Bearer token (existing Gateway auth middleware) and require internal service token for writes.\n   - Persist state in Gateway DB (new table `imap_account_state`): columns: account_id (text), folder (text), last_processed_uid (integer), updated_at (timestamp), updated_by (optional).\n   - Add simple migrations and an index on (account_id, folder).\n\n2. Gateway backend\n   - Storage adapter in gateway service (catalog or a small new DB table via existing DB layer).\n   - Unit tests for read/write semantics and auth.\n\n3. HostAgent changes\n   - Remove use of local file-based state for IMAP runs.\n   - On IMAP run start, call Gateway GET to fetch last_processed_uid for account+folder.\n   - After each successful submission (or at end of run), call Gateway POST/PUT to update last_processed_uid with the latest processed UID.\n   - Add retry/backoff/fail-safe: if Gateway call fails, HostAgent should log warning and fall back to treating last_processed_uid as 0 (to avoid losing messages) and continue processing — but not clobber remote state on write errors.\n\n4. Tests \u0026 docs\n   - Add unit tests for Gateway handlers and HostAgent changes (mock HTTP client in HostAgent tests).\n   - Update `docs/hostagent/email-imap-collector.md` to reflect new behavior and configuration.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n\n- Gateway exposes documented GET/PUT endpoints for IMAP account state and persistently stores state in DB with an index.\n- HostAgent no longer writes/reads per-account IMAP state to local files; instead, it uses the Gateway endpoints.\n- HostAgent includes a safe fallback when Gateway is unreachable (logs and continues without overwriting remote state).\n- Tests exist covering read/write path and a HostAgent test mocking the Gateway API.\n- Docs updated describing the behavior and required Gateway token permissions.\n\nNotes / Risks\n\n- Risk: introducing a single point of failure if Gateway is unavailable; mitigations described above.\n- Backfill/migration: existing local cache files won't be auto-migrated; include a follow-up task to migrate existing local state (optional).\n","acceptance_criteria":"1.

We need a standardized extraction that captures the meaningful plain-text body and any image captions so downstream indexing/embeddings are higher quality.\n\nGoal: Implement an extractor that, for each submitted email, produces a cleaned plain-text body and a list of image captions (sourced from alt attributes, \u003cfigcaption\u003e, adjacent text, or OCR on attached images as an opt-in step). The extractor should run in the ingestion pipeline so the Catalog stores the cleaned body and captions (not the raw html/mime) alongside existing metadata.\n\nDesign notes:\n- Parse MIME with Python's email library to identify parts.\n- Prefer text/plain. If missing, convert html -\u003e text using a reliable converter (e.g., html2text or bleach + lxml text extraction) and remove boilerplate and inline CSS.\n- Strip quoted reply/forward blocks using heuristics (common separators like \"On .* wrote:\", lines starting with \"\u003e\", and HTML elements with classes/ids commonly used for quoted text).\n- Extract image captions:\n  - from \u003cimg alt=\"...\"\u003e attributes\n  - from \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e...\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n  - from text nodes immediately preceding/following img nodes\n  - as an optional worker stage: run OCR on image attachments (controlled by feature flag) and include OCR text as a caption with source=\"ocr\" if no alt/caption found\n- Preserve language metadata and avoid dropping meaningful whitespace or non-latin scripts.\n- Keep it idempotent and safe: do not modify stored original payloads. Add new fields to the document/chunk model as needed (e.g., cleaned_body, image_captions).\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n1) Unit tests: for text/plain, html-only, multipart with inline images (alt + figcaption), and quoted-reply stripping.\n2) Integration test: ingest sample email fixture and verify Catalog (or document record) contains cleaned plain-text snippet and image_captions list.\n3) No changes to original raw MIME payload stored elsewhere. The new fields are additive.\n4) Feature flag or env var to enable/disable OCR (DEFAULT: disabled).\n\nImplementation plan (next steps):\n- Add shared parsing utility in `shared/email_parsing.py` (or existing email utilities) with small functions: parse_mime_parts, html_to_text, strip_quoted, extract_image_captions.\n- Hook into gateway ingestion pipeline to call the extractor before creating document/chunk records.\n- Add unit + integration tests under `test/` using existing fixtures.\n- Add env/config: ENABLE_IMAGE_OCR (false) and doc note.\n\nNotes:\n- Risk: medium (affects ingestion pipeline). Keep changes additive and behind flag if needed.","design":"See description (high level).

{"id":"hv-80","title":"Add OpenAPI exporter endpoint to HostAgent runtime","description":"Goal\nAdd a canonical, runtime OpenAPI exporter to the HostAgent Swift service so the service can serve its OpenAPI spec (JSON and/or YAML) and be the single source-of-truth for API docs. This will eliminate spec drift and allow automation (mkdocs/exporter) to fetch the live spec during docs builds or CI.\n\nBackground\nCurrently the repo contains a static `openapi/hostagent.yaml` authored by hand and a Python exporter that writes a Redoc page for it. HostAgent is a macOS-native Swift service; there is no runtime OpenAPI endpoint. That produces drift risk when new routes or request/response schemas are added in Swift.\n\nScope\n- Add an endpoint to HostAgent that exposes the service's OpenAPI specification at `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml` (YAML optional). The endpoint should be enabled in dev/build configurations and guarded behind admin or local-only access in production if required by config.\n- Generate OpenAPI programmatically from the HostAgent router/handlers and bundled JSON schemas in `Resources/*/schemas/*.schema.json` (merge those into components.schemas). If full programmatic generation is infeasible, provide a build-time task that composes the OpenAPI spec from route metadata + JSON schemas and writes a file to `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` that the server serves statically.\n- Ensure the exporter includes the Collector routes, email utilities, FSWatch, face detection, OCR, entities, modules, metrics, and health endpoints already present in the router.\n- Add minimal tests that exercise the endpoint and verify the presence of key paths and the `CollectorRunRequest` schema in components.\n- Update docs/dev workflow: the Python `scripts/export_openapi.py` (or docs hooks) can optionally fetch the runtime `/openapi.yaml` (if server running) or read the build-time generated `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` during docs builds/CI.\n\nDesign notes\n- Runtime approach (preferred long-term): implement a small OpenAPI-builder utility in Swift that walks the Router/PatternRouteHandler registrations and collects path patterns, methods, and handler metadata. For each route, include a path entry with sensible default request/response schemas, and resolve component schemas by importing JSON schema files from Resources.\n  - Expose endpoints: `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml` (Content-Type application/json / application/x-yaml).\n  - Add a config toggle: `openapi.enabled: true|false`, default true in dev, false in production unless explicitly enabled.\n  - Secure the endpoint optionally with the hostagent auth header (configurable) or limit to localhost only.\n\n- Build-time fallback (lower risk): add a Swift PackageTarget/tool that generates `Resources/OpenAPI/hostagent.yaml` from the same route discovery utility and schema files. Add a Makefile or SPM run target `swift run hostagent-openapi --emit-resources` to write the file into `Resources/OpenAPI/` which will be bundled and served as static files.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n- The HostAgent binary serves an OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.yaml` when `openapi.enabled` is true (or the generated resource file exists). The spec includes paths for collectors (including `imessage` and `email_imap`) and contains `components.schemas.CollectorRunRequest` matching the JSON schema in `Resources/Collectors/schemas/collector_run_request.schema.json`.\n- Unit/integration test that makes a local request to `/openapi.yaml` and asserts the spec contains `/v1/collectors/imessage:run` and `components.schemas.CollectorRunRequest`.\n- `scripts/export_openapi.py` can optionally be updated to fetch the runtime `/openapi.yaml` (if server available) during docs builds — documented in the README/dev docs.\n\nImplementation tasks\n1. Add a new Swift module `HostOpenAPI` or utility inside HostAgent to build the spec.\n2. Implement route-walker that introspects `Router` / `PatternRouteHandler` registrations.\n3. Merge JSON schemas from `Resources/**/schemas/*.schema.json` into `components.schemas`.\n4.

Add config flag to enable/disable endpoint and optional local-only/auth restrictions.\n6. Add tests covering presence of key paths and schemas.\n7. Optional: update `scripts/export_openapi.py` doc/comments to support fetching runtime spec.\n\nNotes / Risks\n- Programmatic route introspection in Swift depends on the router implementation. If introspection is not possible, the build-time generator fallback will be used.\n- Care must be taken to not leak sensitive data (authentication headers, internal endpoints). Default to local-only in production.\n\nEstimate\n- Design + prototype: 1–2 days\n- Implementation + tests + docs: 2–4 days\n\n","design":"See description above for runtime vs build-time designs.

{"id":"hv-83","title":"Compile MailCore2 for Apple Silicon (ARM64) support","description":"Remove the requirement for `arch -x86_64` prefixes by compiling MailCore2 with native ARM64 support or finding an ARM64-compatible alternative.\n\n## Problem\nThe current MailCore2 dependency (`https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2.git`) only ships as an x86_64 framework, requiring all Swift build/test commands to use `arch -x86_64` prefix. This creates:\n- Performance overhead from Rosetta translation\n- Complex development workflow with architecture prefixes\n- Potential CI/CD complications\n- Poor developer experience on Apple Silicon Macs\n\n## Current Workaround\nAll build commands in `hostagent/Makefile` use `arch -x86_64`:\n```makefile\nbuild:\n\tarch -x86_64 swift build\ntest:\n\tarch -x86_64 swift test\n```\n\n## Goals\n- Enable native ARM64 compilation of hostagent\n- Remove `arch -x86_64` prefixes from Makefile\n- Maintain full IMAP functionality (search, fetch, auth)\n- Improve developer experience and performance\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option 1: Fork and Build MailCore2 for ARM64\n- Fork the MailCore2 repository\n- Add ARM64 build configuration\n- Update Package.swift to use the forked version\n- Test IMAP functionality thoroughly\n\n### Option 2: Find ARM64-Compatible Alternative\n- Research alternative Swift IMAP libraries with ARM64 support\n- Evaluate compatibility with existing ImapSession implementation\n- Migrate if suitable alternative found\n\n### Option 3: Build MailCore2 from Source\n- Investigate building MailCore2 from source with ARM64 support\n- Create build scripts for ARM64 compilation\n- Package as local dependency\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n1. `swift build` and `swift test` work without `arch -x86_64` prefix on Apple Silicon\n2. All IMAP functionality (searchMessages, fetchRFC822) works on native ARM64\n3. Makefile updated to remove architecture prefixes\n4. Documentation updated to remove Rosetta requirements\n5. CI/CD pipelines work without architecture workarounds\n6. Performance is equal or better than Rosetta-based builds\n\n## Testing\n- Verify IMAP search and fetch operations work correctly\n- Test with real IMAP servers (iCloud, Gmail)\n- Ensure XOAUTH2 and app-password auth still function\n- Run full test suite on ARM64\n- Performance benchmarking vs Rosetta builds\n\n## Documentation Updates\n- Update `docs/hostagent/email-imap-collector.md` to remove Rosetta requirements\n- Update `hostagent/README.md` build instructions\n- Update any CI/CD documentation\n\n## Risks\n- MailCore2 ARM64 build may have compatibility issues\n- Alternative libraries may lack required features\n- Breaking changes in IMAP functionality\n- Increased build complexity\n\n## Dependencies\n- None (can be worked on independently)\n\n## Notes\n- Current ImapSession implementation is well-tested and should be preserved\n- Consider creating a compatibility layer if switching libraries\n- May need to update Package.resolved and dependency management","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T12:27:35.623053-04:00","updated_at":"2025-10-28T12:27:35.623053-04:00"}
