polls Mail.app cache\n   - Posts v2 document payloads via Gateway `/v1/ingest` or `/v1/ingest/file`\n   - Uses idempotency keys for deduplication\n\n2. **Image Enrichment:** Pre-ingestion processing using `shared.image_enrichment`\n   - For email HTML with embedded images or image attachments\n   - **Three-step enrichment pipeline:**\n     1. **OCR:** HostAgent `/v1/ocr` endpoint (macOS Vision framework) extracts text\n     2. **Entity extraction:** HostAgent extracts dates, amounts, organizations, phone numbers, addresses\n     3. **Captioning:** Ollama vision model (if enabled) generates scene descriptions\n   - Face detection via HostAgent `/v1/face/detect` if needed\n   - Results cached locally in `~/.haven/email_image_cache.json`\n   - All enrichment metadata included in document payload\n\n3. **Entity Extraction:** Use HostAgent's native Vision framework\n   - Call HostAgent `POST /v1/ocr` with image data (for receipts, bills with images)\n   - Extract dates, amounts, organizations, phone numbers, addresses\n   - No external API calls; all processing on-device\n   - Results included in document metadata for downstream indexing\n\n4. **Link Resolver:** Optional Swift CLI helper (similar to imdesc)\n   - `hostagent/Sources/LinkResolver` - WKWebView-based dereferencer\n   - Fetches rendered HTML or downloads PDFs from \"View Online\" links\n   - Returns structured JSON to collector\n   - Collector decides whether to include link target as attachment\n\n5. **Attachment Flow:**\n   - Load image attachments from Mail cache (`~/Library/Mail/V*/Attachments/`)\n   - **Enrich via `shared.image_enrichment.enrich_image()` before upload:**\n     - Run OCR to extract text (HostAgent Vision)\n     - Extract entities (dates, amounts, etc.)\n     - Generate caption describing the image (Ollama vision model)\n     - Cache results to avoid reprocessing\n   - Upload via Gateway `/v1/ingest/file` with metadata (OCR, entities, caption)\n   - Gateway → MinIO (deduplicated by SHA256)\n   - Catalog records document_files linkage\n\n6. **Text Extraction:**\n   - Parse `.emlx` files (RFC 2822 format + plist metadata)\n   - Extract plain text and HTML parts\n   - For HTML emails: optionally render via LinkResolver for full text\n   - Redact email addresses, phone numbers before sending to Catalog\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. `scripts/collectors/collector_email_local.py`\n   - Indexed mode: read Envelope Index SQLite\n   - Crawler mode: scan .emlx files with mtime tracking\n   - State file: `~/.haven/email_collector_state.json`\n   - Image cache: `~/.haven/email_image_cache.json`\n   - Posts to Gateway `/v1/ingest` with `source_type=\"email_local\"`\n\n2. `hostagent/Sources/LinkResolver` Swift CLI\n   - WKWebView-based link dereferencer\n   - Accepts URL, returns rendered text or PDF metadata\n   - Callable via HostAgent endpoint or standalone CLI\n   - Returns JSON: `{url, content_type, text?, pdf_path?}`\n\n3. `tests/test_collector_email_local.py`\n   - Unit tests: parsing, filtering, entity extraction\n   - Integration tests: end-to-end ingestion flow\n   - Privacy tests: verify PII redaction\n   - **Image enrichment tests:** verify OCR, entity extraction, AND captioning work\n\n4. `compose.yaml` profile entry\n   - No Docker service needed (collector runs on host)\n   - Document env vars and setup in README\n\n5. Postgres schema migration\n   - Add `intent` JSONB field to documents table\n   - Add `relevance_score` float field\n   - Create index on `source_type='email_local'`\n\n## Constraints \u0026 Security\n\n- Read-only access to Mail cache; require Full Disk Access in production launchd context\n- Do not make outbound network calls during extraction except Ollama (localhost only)\n- Respect user privacy:\n  - Redact emails, addresses, account numbers from text sent to Catalog/embeddings\n  - Keep raw email content in MinIO only (never in Postgres full text)\n  - Image OCR processed via local HostAgent (macOS Vision framework)\n  - Image captioning via local Ollama (if enabled)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

Entity extraction uses HostAgent `/v1/ocr` endpoint (no external APIs)\n9. **Captioning uses Ollama vision model** (configurable via `OLLAMA_ENABLED` env var)\n\n## Notes and Next Steps\n\n- Start with Indexed mode prototype (read Envelope Index for delta sync)\n- Keep LinkResolver as optional; collector works without it but includes link targets when available\n- Consider adaptive noise model later (per-sender stats) — implement as follow-up task\n- Follow patterns from `collector_imessage.py` and `collector_localfs.py` for consistency\n- **Ensure `shared.image_enrichment.enrich_image()` is called for all image attachments** to get OCR + entities + captions","notes":"Update: Add configurable filtering support.\n\n- Collector must support flexible filters (see task haven-38).
