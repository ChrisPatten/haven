# Getting Started

This page sketches the workflow for contributing to Haven documentation. Content will be expanded alongside the MkDocs integration work.

## Preview Locally

1. Install documentation dependencies (`pip install -r requirements-docs.txt` placeholder).
2. Run `mkdocs serve` from the repo root.
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to preview changes.

## Contribution Workflow

- Create feature branches for doc updates.
- Run the MkDocs preview locally before opening a pull request.
- Link your pull request to the relevant Beads issue.

## Next Steps

Detailed setup instructions and dependency lists will be added once the docs toolchain is finalized.
