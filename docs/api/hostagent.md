This page documents the HostAgent local macOS service API.

- Interactive reference: [HostAgent Reference](hostagent-reference.html)
- Download the OpenAPI spec: [openapi/hostagent.yaml](../openapi/hostagent.yaml)

HostAgent is a macOS-native service that provides capabilities such as health checks, OCR, entity extraction, and collectors (for example, triggering iMessage collectors). The OpenAPI specification is maintained in `openapi/hostagent.yaml` and is used to render the interactive reference.

If you need the machine-readable spec for tooling or client generation, download the YAML file.

Note: The HostAgent runtime is implemented in Swift and is not part of the Python services. This reference is provided as a static OpenAPI document integrated into the docs site.
