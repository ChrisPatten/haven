# Packages required to run the local (host) collector scripts on macOS
# These are separate from container/service dependencies in pyproject.toml
# Install: pip install -r local_requirements.txt

# === macOS / platform-specific ===
# PyObjC Contacts bindings (required for `collector_contacts.py` on macOS)
pyobjc-framework-Contacts

# === HTTP / networking ===
# Used by collectors to post payloads to the gateway and call external services
httpx  # used by collector_contacts.py (preferred client for contacts collector)
requests  # used by imessage/localfs/image_enrichment for uploads and Ollama

# === JSON / serialization / retry ===
orjson  # faster JSON used by collectors when posting
backoff  # retry helpers used by collectors (contacts, image enrichment)

# === Identifier normalization ===
# shared.people_normalization expects these
phonenumbers
idna

# === Image enrichment / OCR / vision ===
# Used by `shared/image_enrichment.py` and the collectors that enrich images
Pillow>=10.0.0
pillow-heif>=0.13.0  # HEIC/HEIF support for Pillow
python-dotenv  # environment variable loading for local runs (helps collectors)


# === File format helpers / parsers ===
biplist  # Apple plist parsing (collectors may read plists)

# === Testing / development ===
pytest

# Notes:
# - The file intentionally includes some optional tooling (Tika, pytesseract)
#   because local image/document enrichment and backfill scripts may use them.
# - Keep this file for host/desktop development only. Service/container
#   dependencies are governed by the project's service requirements and
#   pyproject.toml / requirements.txt for reproducible deployments.
