// EmailLocalHandler removed on branch collector-api
// This file has been moved/removed and is intentionally not part of the build.

/*
 The local email collector implementation previously lived here. It was large and
 is no longer included in the hostagent build. The IMAP-based collector is the
 supported method for email collection (`email_imap`).

 The original implementation is preserved in git history; this placeholder file
 exists so operations that expect the original path can find an indicator.
